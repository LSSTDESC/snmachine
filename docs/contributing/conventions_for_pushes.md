# Conventions for pushing code to `snmachine`

## Coding Conventions

## Naming Conventions

* class names -> PascalCase
* function and variable names -> snake_case
* function names -> start with descriptive verb (eg. get, compute, fit, load)
* hidden function names -> same as function names but starting with `_`
* descriptive names that minimize the number of necessary comments
